# Introduction: London, City of Capital, 1825-2008

London has functioned as a financial hub for over two centuries. It was
through London that British and international savings were funneled into
Latin American sovereign debt, British railroads, Southern African
diamond mines, or North American mortgages. The nineteenth century saw
London grow to become the premiere international investment market, and
witnessed the growth of central banking doctrine at the Bank of England,
the growth of the London Stock Exchange, and the establishment of
supporting institutions such as a financial press. During the financial
turbulence of the inter-war years London sat at the centre of efforts to
maintain the gold standard, and in the aftermath of World War II it was
London where the international market for dollars grew. Sterling
instability in the 20th century was funneled through the London capital
market, and the financial deregulation of the last quarter of the
twentieth century witnessed further growth of the City. This module aims
to analyze the role of London as an international financial hub,
focusing in particular on the role of crises in driving institutional
and regulatory change. We open with the Panic of 1825 – which led to
bank failures stemming from overseas lending to Latin America – and
close with the Global Financial Crisis. The module will be structured
around relevant primary sources, which we will link to ideas from the
broader historiography. The focus of the module is the economic and
financial history of London as a capital market.

## About Group III Modules

Group III modules are distinctive in that they are focused on a large
body of primary source material (approximately 1,000 pages). Students
develop a close familiarity with these ‘specified primary sources’ and
prepare to be examined on their knowledge and understanding of this body
of material at the end of the year. Group IIIs constitute the largest
component of the BA, at 60 credits. Each Group III technically comprises
two separate modules of 30 credits each: one leading to an end-of-year
examination, and the other leading to a dissertation.

# Assessment

## Summative Assessment

### Examination

-   The exam is worth 30 credits.
-   Format: you must EITHER answer two gobbet questions and one essay
    question, OR one gobbet question and two essay questions.
-   The exam paper will contain two gobbet questions and eight essay
    questions.
-   Gobbet questions: each gobbet question reproduces seven gobbets
    (extracts) from primary sources and says: ‘Comment upon THREE
    gobbets from the following.’ For each question, you give three
    SEPARATE comments: one for each gobbet.
-   Essay questions: these are similar in form to essay questions on
    other types of module, but you are encouraged to draw on your
    knowledge of primary sources, as well as relevant secondary
    literature, in your answers.

### Dissertation

-   10,000 words in length; submitted early on in Exam Term.
-   Students devise a dissertation topic and title, taking guidance from
    me.
-   The dissertation must make use of primary source material: this may
    include the primary sources covered in class, but students will
    often make use of other primary source material which they have
    identified.
-   Each student is entitled to up to four half-hour meetings with me to
    discuss their dissertation.
-   Each student can submit to me a maximum of 3,000 words in draft form
    for feedback in a meeting (as part of the allowance of four
    half-hour meetings).
-   Our session in week 6 (after reading week) in the first semester is
    reserved as DISSERTATION WORKSHOP \#1: students will give short
    presentations outlining their ideas for dissertation topics and
    discussing the primary sources and secondary works that will be used
    (details below).
-   Our session in week 11 (after Christmas) in the second semester is
    reserved as DISSERTATION WORKSHOP \#2: students will present their
    progress and discuss how they have used primary sources as evidence
    (details below).

## Formative work

-   Each student will be responsible for introducing the primary sources
    several times during the year – exactly how often depends on class
    size.
-   Each student will write 4 gobbets (500 words) and 2 essays (1,500
    words) as practice.
-   I will grade these assignments provided that they are submitted on
    time.
-   The essays are due by the end of Semester 1 and 2 respectively.
    -   You can simply email the work to me
    -   You can write the essays sooner if you like
    -   I need to get your last essays at least 3 weeks before the exam
        if you want my feedback in time.

## How to write a gobbet

A gobbet is a short commentary on an excerpt from a primary source. You
should typically write 2 paragraphs (about 500-700 words).

In your first paragraph, you should draw out basic information about the
source such as *who* is the author, *what* are they commenting on and
*why*. You may also need to state *when* and draw out which particular
event or events the source is reacting to.

Your second paragraph is a chance to show off your creativity: how does
the source relate to some of the broader intellectual themes discussed
in secondary sources? What is the *significance* of the source? What
does it reveals that is *of interest to scholars* and why is it
interesting to them? Did the source itself have consequences when read
by others? Do we know, from other sources, that the author’s views later
changed? Does the identity of the author, or the timing of the source’s
writing, give it a particular value to the historian? You can also use
this paragraph for some more sophisticated analyses of potential source
biases, and for the contextualization of the source’s claims.

In grading a gobbet, your work in the first paragraph is necessary but
not sufficient for a good grade: if you wrote a perfect first paragraph
and an atrocious (or non-existent) second paragraph I would grade you
between 55-60.

# Introduction, key concepts, and course mechanics

The first class will start by providing some background on the themes we
will be covering and getting to know each other. Please read some of
Kindleberger to familiarize yourself with some background for financial
crises which will be useful throughout the course. The Michie and Mollan
piece will help with some broad perspective on how the City changed from
the 19th to the 20th centuries. We will not discuss these in class, but
they are a good place to start.

# Lending money abroad: the global sovereign debt crisis of 1825

We will start with what is often viewed as the first international
sovereign debt crisis centered on London. We will try to get a sense for
the nature of the 1825 crisis and its causes, and then think through the
primary sources in terms of what they tell us about the information
environment for speculators in the early 19th century.

# The London Stock Exchange Archive Visit

We will be visiting Guildhall library for a visit to the London Stock
Exchange archive as well as other useful and important resources for
business and economic historians. Our visit will take place at 10:30 am
at Guildhall Library. Please arrive early.

In preparation for the visit it would be good to read Morgan & Thomas
for background and I would also like you to look at the rules and
regulations of the exchange in 1847 which will help you to understand
the structure of the exchange *and* the structure of the archive we will
be visiting.

To see where the LSE fits in more broadly read Taylor’s article on LSE
vs outside brokers and look at the polemic against the LSE brokers
written by Mortimer.

# The London Stock Exchange in the 19th century

This week is our opportunity to discuss the material we have covered on
the LSE. We will read three articles from different traditions (history
of science and technology, economic history, economics) on the LSE which
I hope will offer up some different ways to think about how you might
research it. We will also be looking at the testimony given in a Royal
Commission into the LSE that offers some scope for understanding how
brokers and dealers thought about their work (or anyway, what they would
admit to thinking about it in front of an inquiry!).

# The railway mania of 1845 and crisis of 1847

The railway mania is possibly the first major tech-stock bubble –
certainly the most spectacular one at least until the dotcom bubble of
the 1990s. We will try to get a sense for the mania, and then look in
more detail at the process of company promotion.
