# Introduction: London, City of Capital, 1825-2008 {#introduction-london-city-of-capital-1825-2008 .unnumbered}

London has functioned as a financial hub for over two centuries. It was
through London that British and international savings were funneled into
Latin American sovereign debt, British railroads, Southern African
diamond mines, or North American mortgages. The nineteenth century saw
London grow to become the premiere international investment market, and
witnessed the growth of central banking doctrine at the Bank of England,
the growth of the London Stock Exchange, and the establishment of
supporting institutions such as a financial press. During the financial
turbulence of the inter-war years London sat at the centre of efforts to
maintain the gold standard, and in the aftermath of World War II it was
London where the international market for dollars grew. Sterling
instability in the 20th century was funneled through the London capital
market, and the financial deregulation of the last quarter of the
twentieth century witnessed further growth of the City. This module aims
to analyze the role of London as an international financial hub,
focusing in particular on the role of crises in driving institutional
and regulatory change. We open with the Panic of 1825 -- which led to
bank failures stemming from overseas lending to Latin America -- and
close with the Global Financial Crisis. The module will be structured
around relevant primary sources, which we will link to ideas from the
broader historiography. The focus of the module is the economic and
financial history of London as a capital market.

## About Group III Modules

Group III modules are distinctive in that they are focused on a large
body of primary source material (approximately 1,000 pages). Students
develop a close familiarity with these 'specified primary sources' and
prepare to be examined on their knowledge and understanding of this body
of material at the end of the year. Group IIIs constitute the largest
component of the BA, at 60 credits. Each Group III technically comprises
two separate modules of 30 credits each: one leading to an end-of-year
examination, and the other leading to a dissertation.

# Assessment {#assessment .unnumbered}

## Summative Assessment

### Examination

-   The exam is worth 30 credits; lasts 3 hours; requires 3 questions to
    be answered.
-   Format: you must EITHER answer two gobbet questions and one essay
    question, OR one gobbet question and two essay questions.
-   The exam paper will contain two gobbet questions and eight essay
    questions.
-   Gobbet questions: each gobbet question reproduces seven gobbets
    (extracts) from primary sources and says: 'Comment upon THREE
    gobbets from the following.' For each question, you give three
    SEPARATE comments: one for each gobbet.
-   Essay questions: these are similar in form to essay questions on
    other types of module, but you are encouraged to draw on your
    knowledge of primary sources, as well as relevant secondary
    literature, in your answers.
-   Whether the exam will be online or in person is *to be determined*.
    Any changes to exam format stemming from public health measures will
    be communicated to you during the year.

### Dissertation

-   10,000 words in length; submitted early on in Exam Term.
-   Students devise a dissertation topic and title, taking guidance from
    me.
-   The dissertation must make use of primary source material: this may
    include the primary sources covered in class, but students will
    often make use of other primary source material which they have
    identified.
-   Each student is entitled to up to four half-hour meetings with me to
    discuss their dissertation.
-   Each student can submit to me a maximum of 3,000 words in draft form
    for feedback in a meeting (as part of the allowance of four
    half-hour meetings).
-   Our session in week 6 (after reading week) in the first semester is
    reserved as DISSERTATION WORKSHOP \#1: students will give short
    presentations outlining their ideas for dissertation topics and
    discussing the primary sources and secondary works that will be used
    (details below).
-   Our session in week 11 (after Christmas) in the second semester is
    reserved as DISSERTATION WORKSHOP \#2: students will present their
    progress and discuss how they have used primary sources as evidence
    (details below).

## Formative work

-   Each student will be responsible for introducing the primary sources
    4 times (twice each semester)
    -   Given student numbers, this will be done in teams
    -   'Presentation' slots for semester 1 will be picked in the first
        session
-   Each student will write 4 gobbets (600 words) and 2 essays (2,500
    words) as practice.
-   I will grade these assignments provided that they are submitted on
    time.
-   The essays are due by the end of Week 8, and the end of week 16.
    -   You can simply email the work to me
    -   You can write the essays sooner if you like
-   The gobbets are due 1 week after you present
    -   For more on how to write a gobbet see below
    -   *You* pick the passage you want to write a gobbet about and
        include the passage in your written response
    -   It does not *have* to be on the topic you were presenting (but
        why not?)

### Notes on presentations

-   These are not formal presentations, you are simply expected to
    initiate the discussion of the sources by talking about them for \~5
    minutes.
-   There will be 2-3 presenters each week: you will need to work
    together to coordinate your discussion
    -   Each presenter should speak for \~5 minutes.
-   If you want to make slides/use pictures/other media feel free
-   Focus on the writers biases and motivations
-   Focus on the relationship between the sources and the ideas in the
    secondary material
-   Focus on what kind of interesting questions the sources raise for
    further discussion

### How to write a gobbet

A gobbet is a short commentary on an excerpt from a primary source. You
should typically write 2 paragraphs (about 500-700 words).

In your first paragraph, you should draw out basic information about the
source such as *who* is the author, *what* are they commenting on and
*why*. You may also need to state *when* and draw out which particular
event or events the source is reacting to.

Your second paragraph is a chance to show off your creativity: how does
the source relate to some of the broader intellectual themes discussed
in secondary sources? What is the *significance* of the source? What
does it reveals that is *of interest to scholars* and why is it
interesting to them? Did the source itself have consequences when read
by others? Do we know, from other sources, that the author's views later
changed? Does the identity of the author, or the timing of the source's
writing, give it a particular value to the historian? You can also use
this paragraph for some more sophisticated analyses of potential source
biases, and for the contextualization of the source's claims.

In grading a gobbet, your work in the first paragraph is necessary but
not sufficient for a good grade: if you wrote a perfect first paragraph
and an atrocious (or non-existent) second paragraph I would grade you
between 55-60.

# Introduction, key concepts, and course mechanics

The first class will start by providing some background on the themes we
will be covering. For the lecture, I will try to place the capital
market into long-run perspective and discuss speculative movements. I
will also take some time to review the formative and summative
assessments in this course.
