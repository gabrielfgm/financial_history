Please meet me in front of the Bank of England on Wednesday February 1st at 10:15am for our 10:30 appointment. The appointment is scheduled to last roughly 1.5 hours although if you need to leave early let me know.

The bank's address is Bank of England, Threadneedle St, London, EC2R 8AH. For this visit **please bring a valid ID** (passport or drivers license). If you anticipate trouble getting ID please let me know in advance and I will speak to the archivists.
