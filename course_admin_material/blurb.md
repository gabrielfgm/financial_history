# London, City of Capital, 1825-2008

London has functioned as a financial hub for over two centuries. It was through London that British and international savings were funneled into Latin American sovereign debt, British railroads, Southern African diamond mines, or North American mortgages. The nineteenth century saw London grow to become the premiere international investment market, and witnessed the growth of central banking doctrine at the Bank of England, the growth of the London Stock Exchange, and the establishment of supporting institutions such as a financial press. During the financial turbulence of the inter-war years London sat at the centre of efforts to maintain the gold standard, and in the aftermath of World War II it was London where the international market for dollars grew. Sterling instability in the 20th century was funneled through the London capital market, and the financial deregulation of the last quarter of the twentieth century witnessed further growth of the City. This module aims to analyze the role of London as an international financial hub, focusing in particular on the role of crises in driving institutional and regulatory change. We open with the Panic of 1825 -- which led to bank failures stemming from overseas lending to Latin America -- and close with the Global Financial Crisis. The module will be structured around relevant primary sources, which we will link to ideas from the broader historiography. The focus of the module is the economic and financial history of London as a capital market.

The dissertation, 10,000 words in length, aims to develop students' research and writing skills. In consultation with their supervisor, students will devise a research topic within the scope of the level 6 special subject module with which the dissertation is associated. The dissertation will be based on primary texts from the body of 800-1,000 pages of source material prescribed for the course under the agreed University of London parameters for Group III papers, though students are also encouraged to demonstrate their research skills by identifying and analysing relevant primary source materials beyond those prescribed. The dissertation will represent an advanced engagement in historical research in the same format as an academic article.
