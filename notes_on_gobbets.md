+ 1 or 2 secondary reading per week
+ Gives bibliographic info
    * Answer is 2 paragraphs
    * Do three in an hour (20 minutes each but prep time)
    * Para 1: Why pick the passage (not the source). Will have an historical point -- will be linked to class discussion. 1/3 of marks roughly
    * Para 2: a chance to show-off. Relate to a broader theme of the course
    * If you only nail para 1 Peter would be inclined to grade just below 60
+ For essays go for very broad topics and say what they will be
+
