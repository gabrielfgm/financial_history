# Semester 1

## 1. Economic and Financial History: An introduction to key concepts

The course will start by providing some background on the themes we will 
be covering. For the lecture, I will try to place the capital market into
long-run perspective and discuss speculative movements. For the primary 
sources, we will reflect on how to read this material.

We will spend a few weeks on international lending booms and contractions
and their role in generating crises and political and economic
response. We will begin with the 1825 crisis, which emerged out of
a boom in international lending driven by the end of the Napoleonic
Wars and the growth of independent republics in particular in 
Latin America.
