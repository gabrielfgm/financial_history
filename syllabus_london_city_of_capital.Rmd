## 1. Economic and Financial History: An introduction to key concepts

The first class will start by providing some background on the themes we will 
be covering. For the lecture, I will try to place the capital market into
long-run perspective and discuss speculative movements. For the primary 
sources, we will reflect on how to read this material. We will also take
some time to look at the databases that exist that could be helpful in
this area.

# International Lending Booms

We will spend a few weeks on international lending booms and contractions
and their role in generating crises and political and economic
response. We will begin with the 1825 crisis, which emerged out of
a boom in international lending driven by the end of the Napoleonic
Wars and the growth of independent republics in particular in 
Latin America.

# Regulation and Innovation

Under this heading we are going to consider several waves of domestic
investment that resulted in asset price bubbles. We are also
going to consider the evolution of corporate regulation and
how regulatory change and investment behavior are historically
linked. We will also examine how investors have informed
themselves, or been misled, by newspapers and rating agencies. 
And finally, we will spend a week looking at what we know
about the characteristics of British investors.

Banking crises are a particularly dangerous and severe

banking crises. Second, we will look at the banking crisis
