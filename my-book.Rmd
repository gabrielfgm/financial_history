# Introduction: London, City of Capital, 1825-2008 {-}

London has functioned as a financial hub for over two centuries. It was through London that British and international savings were funneled into Latin American sovereign debt, British railroads, Southern African diamond mines, or North American mortgages. The nineteenth century saw London grow to become the premiere international investment market, and witnessed the growth of central banking doctrine at the Bank of England, the growth of the London Stock Exchange, and the establishment of supporting institutions such as a financial press. During the financial turbulence of the inter-war years London sat at the centre of efforts to maintain the gold standard, and in the aftermath of World War II it was London where the international market for dollars grew. Sterling instability in the 20th century was funneled through the London capital market, and the financial deregulation of the last quarter of the twentieth century witnessed further growth of the City. This module aims to analyze the role of London as an international financial hub, focusing in particular on the role of crises in driving institutional and regulatory change. We open with the Panic of 1825 -- which led to bank failures stemming from overseas lending to Latin America -- and close with the Global Financial Crisis. The module will be structured around relevant primary sources, which we will link to ideas from the broader historiography. The focus of the module is the economic and financial history of London as a capital market.

# Introduction, key concepts, and course mechanics

The first class will start by providing some background on the themes we will 
be covering. For the lecture, I will try to place the capital market into
long-run perspective and discuss speculative movements. I will also take
some time to review the formative and summative assessments in this course.
